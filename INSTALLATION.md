# Installing War3Source #

## Supported Games ##

The following games are currently supported by War3Source:

* Great support
 * Team Fortress 2
 * Counter-Strike Source
 * Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

* Engine support
 * Left 4 Dead
 * Left 4 Dead 2

If you plan to run War3Source with a Left4Dead game you will have to get custom tailored races and shopitems as the stock ones are not suited for Left4Dead gameplay

## Requirements ##

* A Gameserver with a supported game
 * A recent Sourcemod snapshot (http://www.sourcemod.net/snapshots.php, at least from the 1.5 branch)
 * A recent Metamod snapshot (http://www.sourcemm.net/snapshots, at least from the 1.10 branch)
 * Sourcemod configured to use a database (sqlite is fine)

## Installation guide ##

* If you don't know anything about compiling the source manually you can grab a compiled build from our build server at http://ownageclan.com/jenkins/job/War3Source-Default1/

* Simply put the addons folder into your game folder where Source- and Metamod should have already created a addons folder
* The sound folder belongs into your games sound folder as well as on your fastdl server
* The optional folder contains various things that are not necessary for a base installation
